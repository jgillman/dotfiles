# vim

My editor of choice.

I use [vim-plug][] to manage my plugins. See below for setting that up:

[vim-plug]: https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug

## Install

```sh
# Install plugins and quit
vim +PlugInstall +qall
```

## Local config

Local configurations can be set in `~/.vimrc.local` which is source at the end of `.vimrc`.
