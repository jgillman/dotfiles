# jgillman's sepcial dotfiles

## Shoutout

The real core of these dotfiles are from [holman's
dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). I had been holding off using
GitHub for my dotfiles simply because I wasn't aware of a good way of
automatically symlinking them and keeping them organized. holman's use of topic
folders and a Rakefile to automate symlinking has made it too easy not to. All
credit goes to him.

## dotfiles

Dotfiles essentially what makes your environment *yours*. All your unique little
tweaks and settings that make your computer completely unusable and foreign to
others. I had originally kept all my dotfiles in Dropbox which worked really
nicely for a long time. Two big issues I had with my Dropbox setup is that 1) I
would manually have to symlink new files/folder and 2) I couldn't use them on
remote development machines (where I often work).

Also, to steal directly from [holman](https://github.com/holman):

## install

- `git clone git://github.com/holman/dotfiles ~/.dotfiles`
- `cd ~/.dotfiles`
- `rake install`

The install rake task will symlink the appropriate files in `.dotfiles` to your
home directory. Everything is configured and tweaked within `~/.dotfiles`,
though.

I've included the vim plugins I use as submodules in git. Should you want to
use them as well you must instansiate them after you clone the initial repo.

- `git submodule init`
- `git submodule update`

On top of that, [wincent's Command-T](https://github.com/wincent/Command-T)
plugin must be initialized as well. To use Command-T you must also have vim
with ruby support, I'll let you figure that out.

- `cd ~/.vim/bundle/command-t/ruby/command-t`
- `ruby extconf.rb`
- `make`

## topical

Everything's built around topic areas. If you're adding a new area to your
forked dotfiles — say, "Java" — you can simply add a `java` directory and put
files in there. Anything with an extension of `.zsh` will get automatically
included into your shell. Anything with an extension of `.symlink` will get
symlinked without extension into `$HOME` when you run `rake install`.

## components

There's a few special files in the hierarchy.

- **bin/**: Anything in `bin/` will get added to your `$PATH` and be made
  available everywhere.
- **topic/\*.zsh**: Any files ending in `.zsh` get loaded into your
  environment.
- **topic/\*.symlink**: Any files ending in `*.symlink` get symlinked into
  your `$HOME`. This is so you can keep all of those versioned in your dotfiles
  but still keep those autoloaded files in your home directory. These get
  symlinked in when you run `rake install`.
- **topic/\*.completion.sh**: Any files ending in `completion.sh` get loaded
  last so that they get loaded after we set up zsh autocomplete functions.
