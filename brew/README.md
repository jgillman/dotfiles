# Homebrew (brew)

> The missing package manager for OS X

## Install

The `brew` script will install all of my commonly used tools. It will:

- install `brew` if it's missing
- update itself
- install the latest stable `bash` and `zsh`
- set up `brew cask`
- install a handful of apps with cask

```sh
# Kick off the install with
~/.dotfiles/brew/brew
```
