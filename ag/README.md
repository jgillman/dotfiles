https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher

> The Silver Searcher is a tool for searching code. It started off as a clone of [Ack](http://beyondgrep.com/), but their feature sets have since diverged slightly. In typical usage, Ag is 5-10x faster than Ack. See [the GitHub page](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher) for more info.
